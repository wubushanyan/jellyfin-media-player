mkdir jmp; cd jmp
git clone https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv-build.git
cd mpv-build
echo --enable-libmpv-shared > mpv_options
echo --disable-cplayer >> mpv_options
./rebuild -j4
sudo ./install
sudo ldconfig
cd ~/jmp/
git clone git://github.com/iwalton3/jellyfin-media-player
cd jellyfin-media-player
./download_webclient.sh
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local/ ..
make -j4
sudo make install
rm -rf ~/jmp/
```

## Building for Windows

Please install:
 - [cmake](https://cmake.org/download/) - cmake-3.20.0-windows-x86_64.msi
   - Add cmake to the path.
 - [ninja](https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/releases)
   - Place this in the build directory.
 - [QT](https://www.qt.io/download-thank-you?hsLang=en)
   - This package is huge. You also need to make a QT account...
   - Check "MSVC 2019 64-bit" and "Qt WebEngine" under QT 5.15.2.
 - [VS2019 Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2019)
   - Again this will use a lot of disk space. The installer is small though.
 - [libmpv1](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mpv-player-windows/files/libmpv/)
   - Place the contents in the build directory, in a subfolder called `mpv`.
   - Move the contents of the `include` folder to an `mpv` folder inside the `include` folder.
   - Move the `mpv-1.dll` to `mpv.dll`.
 - [WIX](https://wixtoolset.org/releases/v3.11.2/stable)

You need to run these commands in git bash.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iwalton3/jellyfin-media-player
cd jellyfin-media-player
./download_webclient.sh
cd build
```

Open the "x86_x64 Cross Tools Command Prompt for VS 2019". `cd` to the `build` directory. Run:

```
set PATH=%PATH%;C:\Program Files (x86)\WiX Toolset v3.11\bin
cmake -GNinja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=output -DCMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM=ninja.exe -DQTROOT=C:/Qt/5.15.2/msvc2019_64 -DMPV_INCLUDE_DIR=mpv/include -DMPV_LIBRARY=mpv/mpv.dll -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=output ..
lib /def:mpv\mpv.def /out:mpv\mpv.dll.lib /MACHINE:X64
ninja
ninja windows_package
```

## Building for MacOS

Install [QT 5.15.2](https://www.qt.io/download-thank-you?hsLang=en), remember to check `Qt WebEngine`.

Then run the following commands (replace <QT_DIR> with your QT installation location):

```bash
brew install mpv ninja
./download_webclient.sh
cd build
cmake -GNinja -DQTROOT=<QT_DIR> -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=output ..
ninja install
```

To create redistributable bundle, some library paths need to be fixed. At the project root directory, run:

```bash
python3 ./scripts/fix-install-names.py ./build/output/Jellyfin\ Media\ Player.app
```

## Log File Location

 - Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\JellyfinMediaPlayer\logs`
 - Linux: `~/.local/share/jellyfinmediaplayer/logs/`
 - Linux (Flatpak): `~/.var/app/com.github.iwalton3.jellyfin-media-player/data/jellyfinmediaplayer/logs/`
 - macOS: `~/Library/Logs/Jellyfin Media Player/`

## Config File Location

The main configuration file is called `jellyfinmediaplayer.conf`. You can also add a `mpv.conf` to configure MPV directly.

 - Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\JellyfinMediaPlayer\`
 - Linux: `~/.local/share/jellyfinmediaplayer/`
 - Linux (Flatpak): `~/.var/app/com.github.iwalton3.jellyfin-media-player/data/jellyfinmediaplayer/`
 - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Jellyfin Media Player/`

## Web Debugger

To get browser devtools, use remote debugging.

 - Run the application with the command argument `--remote-debugging-port=9222`.
 - Open Chromium or Google Chrome.
 - Navigate to `chrome://inspect/#devices`.
 - You can now access the developer tools.

If you have problems:

 - Make sure "Discover Network Targets" is checked.
 - Make sure `localhost:9222` is in the list under "Configure...".
 - Make sure `--remote-debugging-port=9222` is specified correctly.
